Closure Library Skeletons: Plovr Hello World<br />
============================================<br />

This repository contains varius skeletons used for development with Closure Library, Compiler and Plovr.<br />
It helps beginners to start.<br />

To put your script in the workbench with Plovr up your sleeve, instructions for Mac OS X below.<br />

cd googlemaps<br />
open main.html<br />
make<br />
( leave the terminal window open, press CTRL + C you are done running your script in the workbench )<br />

Now edit main.js or any other script to your heartâ€™s content,<br />
with your favourite text editor, I tend to use vim. :set omnifunc=javascriptcomplete#CompleteJS<br />

to test it just reload the file main.html that you opened in your browser.<br />
